# Zelda_BoTW_Weapons_Analysis
An analysis on the weapons, shields, and bows in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

The operability of these combat items comes down to **2 characteristics**: durability and strength.
- **Durability:** Weapons in BotW do not last forever, they break after certain amount of use, then a new weapon has to be used, and cycle repeats. In the game, durability is the measure of how much you can shoot/or hit an enemy with a weapon or bow; or in the case of shields, how many hits can be endured. Weapons with higher durability last longer before breaking.
- **Strength:** This is associated with attack power. A weapon's strength stat is the damage inflicted upon enemies (meaning that's the amount taken off their health for each hit). The higher the strength, the more damage you can do to enemies.

In my analysis, I started with an overview of the data using **descriptive statistics**, explored the relationship between durability and strength through **correlation analysis**, used **comparative analysis** to compare the performance of different item types, and finally, applied **Pareto optimization** to guide the selection of the best combinations.
